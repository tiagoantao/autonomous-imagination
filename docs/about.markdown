Computers, computing and all that stuff...

EXPLAIN WHY

## Our perspective

Here are what we want to use computers for:

- Imagination and Creativity
- Autonomy
- Decentralization
- Individuation

I will let you think about imagination, creativity and decentralization
without giving you any take about those topics.

Let's chat a bit about autonomy.

If you are dependent on Google for your email, web site, photos,
video production, etc... One can argue that you are a bit dependent.

Facebook, Instagram, ... No no no

So we want to be as self-reliant as possible, and this is not the way.

But, I am writing to you from GitHub, which is owned by Microsoft.
That is odd, right?

Yes and no.

This site is maintained on my local machine using open technologies.
It would be reasonably easy to move it to another hosting provider.
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a static site generator, so it
is not tied to GitHub. It doesn't need any execution environment
after generating the static files.

So, for me, this is not a problem.

Your mileage may vary. It's a gray area.

I also use an external email provider. I will later explain why I
believe this is reasonable.

And many other grey things. Outsourcing cost and infrastructure is
a trade-off.

## Expectations

- You have Internet at home or similar
- You are comfortable around computing technology
- You have a reasonable router (more on that later)
- You have a computer that can run Linux. Something as simple as a Raspberry Pi
- You can get an external hard drive or USB stick
